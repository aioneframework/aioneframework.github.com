To be more specific it is a highly scalable as well as storage platform since it has the ability to store as well as distribute large amounts of data through the inexpensive service that operates simultaneously. In fact, some of the big companies including Facebook and Google are customized to use Hadoop so as to save and manage lots of data sets. This has been resolved since few years and has now become the urged requirement of the individuals.

                                    <p class="line-height-21 font-size-17  pt-10">In future, you will definitely find this facility in which you can easily search data. Because it consists of assortment accessible for different themes and it is also provided with the access to create your own MapReduce programming. At present, it is not available but in future, this will help in analyzing the task and make it quite easy to do.</p>

                                    <p class="line-height-21 font-size-17  pt-10">Basically, it does not require any data structure and the only thing that you need to do is to put it in the format and the remaining work will be done automatically. In addition to that each and every data can be structured in different ways at different time depending upon the requirement. Most of the relative data bases are concerned with Schema-On- Write but the Hadoop is using an interesting aspect called as Schema-On- Read.</p>
                                    </li>

                                    <p class="line-height-21 font-size-17  pt-10">By using the advanced Hadoop it becomes very easy to read and write that is enabled by fast when compared with others. This will become much more advanced in future along with the ability to eliminate any sorts of delay while getting in contact with the database engine. So this can be incorporated with fast acknowledgment and writing technology so as to make the individuals feel comfortable with that.</p>
