You can purchase as many domains as you can but for this, you need to have an extra hosting space. This is the main reason why it is important to have a web hosting account that will simply allow you to add any number of domains in it. It is not sure that every website requires multiple domains but there are only a few categories that need such specifications. So it is better to know about the business after which you can easily understand whether it requires multiple domains or not.</p>

As it is a new website you have to purchase a share hosting plan. This is an ideal way in which you can save lots of money on the hosting bills. The shared hosting services are provided to the individuals who can access multiple websites. For each web server, it has its own internet domain name. Nowadays, most of the web hosting companies are releasing this type of services so as to satisfy the customers requirements. By using shared services you can expect your website to grow very easily.</p>

You can purchase as many domains as you can but for this, you need to have an extra hosting space. This is the main reason why it is important to have a web hosting account that will simply allow you to add any number of domains in it. It is not sure that every website requires multiple domains but there are only a few categories that need such specifications. So it is better to know about the business after which you can easily understand whether it requires multiple domains or not.</p>

Yet you need not get panicked instead you can proceed with them if you feel that the company is fulfilling your requirements. The web hosting contracts may be extended from 1 to 5 years. And one such offer is provided by the Lunarpages which has a subscription period of 5 years. However, it is not necessary that you should get committed to such a long-term hosting contract, but it is up to you to decide whether you can take up or not. It is ideal to sign for the web post for any period, but not more than 3 years. You have to make sure that whether they provide a money backguarantee or not. If they can provide then you can blindly follow them.</p>
